## üõ†Ô∏è Projects  

### 1. **Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) AHB Protocol Implementation**  
**Description**:  
This project involves the design and verification of the AMBA AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) protocol, which is widely used in SoC (System-on-Chip) designs for high-speed communication.  

**Features**:  
- Designed a master, slave, and arbiter module for efficient data transfer.  
- Implemented burst transfers, split transactions, and pipelined operations.  
- Verified the design using a Verilog testbench with random stimulus generation.  
- Optimized for area, power, and timing constraints.  

**Tech Stack**: Verilog, SystemVerilog, ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado

### 2. **UART Protocol Design and Verification**  
**Description**:  
This project focuses on designing a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) for serial communication, a critical interface in embedded systems.  

**Features**:  
- Developed transmitter and receiver modules with configurable baud rates.  
- Implemented parity bit checking and error detection.  
- Verified communication between UART modules using a self-checking Verilog testbench.  
- Synthesized the design for FPGA deployment.  

**Tech Stack**: Verilog, SystemVerilog, ModelSim, FPGA
